    <p class="text-start lead text-dark pt-2">Bootstrap is a free and open-source CSS framework directed at responsive, mobile-first front-end web development. It contains CSS- and (optionally) JavaScript-based 
         design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation, and other interface components.</p>
       <h2 class="text-warning bg-light">Features</h2> 
       <p class="lead text-body pt-1">Bootstrap is an HTML, CSS & JS Library that focuses on simplifying the development of informative web pages (as opposed to web apps). The primary purpose of adding it to a web project 
        is to apply Bootstrap's choices of color, size, font and layout to that project. As such, the primary factor is whether the developers in charge find those choices to their liking. 
        Once added to a project, Bootstrap provides basic style definitions for all HTML elements. The result is a uniform appearance for prose, tables and form elements across web browsers. 
        In addition, developers can take advantage of CSS classes defined in Bootstrap to further customize the appearance of their contents. For example, Bootstrap has provisioned for light- and 
        dark-colored tables, page headings, more prominent pull quotes, and text with a highlight.
        The most prominent components of Bootstrap are its layout components, as they affect an entire web page. The basic layout component is called "Container", as every other element in the page is placed in it. 
        Developers can choose between a fixed-width container and a fluid-width container. While the latter always fills the width of the web page, the former uses one of the five predefined fixed widths, 
        depending on the size of the screen showing the page:
        <ul class="text-primary lead w-25 h-25 border bg-dark bg-gradient border-secondary border-info ">
            <li>Smaller than 576 pixels</li>
            <li>576–768 pixels</li>
            <li>768–992 pixels</li>
            <li>992–1200 pixels</li>
            <li>Larger than 1200 pixels</li>
        </ul></p>
